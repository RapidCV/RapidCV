## Contributing to Rapid CV

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Rapid CV! We welcome contributions from everyone. Please follow the guidelines below to ensure a smooth and productive collaboration.

### 1. Fork the Repository
* Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the project page.
* This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone Your Fork
Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rapid-cv.git
```

### 3. Create a Branch
Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
```bash
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

### 4. Make Your Changes
Make your changes to the codebase. Ensure you follow the project's coding conventions and standards.

### 5. Commit Your Changes
Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
```bash
git commit -m "Add new feature: [Brief description of the feature]"
```

### 6. Push to Your Fork
Push your changes back to your forked repository:
```bash
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request
Go to the original repository and click on the "Pull Requests" tab. Click the "New Pull Request" button, select your branch, and submit the pull request. Please provide a clear description of the changes you’ve made.

### Guidelines
* __Code Style__: Follow the existing code style and structure.
* __Documentation__: Update documentation if you add new features or modify existing ones.
* __Testing__: Ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality. Write tests for new features if applicable.
* __Issues__: Before submitting a new feature request or bug report, please check if it already exists.

## Best Practices for Collaboration in Git
### 1. Use Branches for Each Feature/Task
* Each contributor should create a new branch for every feature or task they might want to work on.
This keeps the main branch (often master or main ) stable and free from partially completed
work.
* Name branches clearly, such as ```feature/user-auth , fix/header-alignment , or
improvement/readme.```
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
### 2. Create Pull Requests (PRs)
* When a contributor finishes their feature on a separate branch, they should create a __pull
request (PR)__ to merge their branch into master/main .
* This PR should be reviewed by at least one from our team. It’s a good opportunity to
check for bugs, ensure code quality, and avoid conflicts.
* In GitHub, you can create a PR after pushing your branch:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```
Then create a PR from the repository interface.

### 3. Avoid Large, Unmanageable Branches
* Keep your branches small and focused on a single task or feature. This makes reviewing
easier and reduces the chances of conflicts.
* It’s better to create multiple small PRs than a large one that becomes difficult to review.
